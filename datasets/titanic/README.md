# Description
The data is obtained from [Kaggle's Titanic ML Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
 The challenge is to use 
use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### Variable Notes

- **Pclass:** A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
  - 1st = Upper
  - 2nd = Middle
  - 3rd = Lower

- **Age:** Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5

- **SibSp:** The dataset defines family relations in this way...
  - Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
  - Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

- **Parch:** The dataset defines family relations in this way...
  - Parent = mother, father
  - Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
  - Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
