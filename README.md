# Files
* [California Housing Price Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/KelvinMumo/Machine-Learning/blob/main/California%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb) - This Jupyter notebook explore the use of various ML algorithms to develop models to predict housing prices in the state of California. The models covered in this notebook are `Linear Regression`, `Decision Trees`, `Random Forest`, and `Support Vector Regression` (SVR). Model otimization techniques utilized to find the best combination of hyperparameters are `Grid Search` and `Random Search`

* [Titanic.ipynb](github.com/KelvinMumo/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb) - Exploring various ML classifiers—Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—to develop models that predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
